    Last Block:
    Given a reference to the blockchain,
    When this function is called,
    Then the last block of the blockchain is referenced

    Hash:
    Given a block,
    When this function is called,
    Then a SHA-256 hash of the block is created

Test story: constructor
    As a system, 
    when a prompt is received for a new coin, 
    I would like to create a field for a blank chain, create a blank field for all current and previous transactions, and create a set of nodes to protect against duplicates.

Test story: new_block
    As a system, 
    when prompted for a new block in a parent blockchain, 
    I would like to expand the size of the chain, add the time the block was created, update the list of current transactions, update the previous hash, and finally add the new block to the chain.

proof_of_work(self, last_proof)
        Given a referrence to the blockchain and the previous proof the blockchain succeeded,
        When this function is called,
        Then returns the int value of the proof.

valid_proof(last_proof, proof)
        Given the previous proof the blockchain succeeded and the current proof that the blockchain succeeds,
        When this function is called,
        Then returns the boolean value true if the proof is valid, and false if the proof is not valid.
        
Lauren Sachs:

    Resolve Conflicts:
    Given multiple users using the same blockchain
    When multiple users attempt to update the blockchain and a  conflict occurs
    Then the blockchain updates to the longer, more updated valid chain
    
    New Transaction:
    Given a user and an existing blochchain
    When a new transaction occurs
    Then the program gives the user a new memory location for a new secure transaction
